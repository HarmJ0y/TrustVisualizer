TrustVisualizer
====================

Simple Python script that takes the output from [PowerView's](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) `Get-DomainTrustMapping | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation trusts.csv` and transforms it to GraphMl. This output can be visualized in any number of ways, including with the [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) project.

The graph output will represent the access direction (opposite of trust direction).

Heaily adapted from @sixdub's [DomainTrustExplorer](https://github.com/sixdub/DomainTrustExplorer/) project.
Python script for analyis of the "Trust.csv" file generated by Veil PowerView. Provides graph based analysis and output.

yEd intstructions from [DomainTrustExplorer](https://github.com/sixdub/DomainTrustExplorer/blob/master/README.md):

Tested on Mac OSX with yEd for visualization.
Parsing colors and labels in yEd (GraphML):
	-Edit->Properties Mapper
	-Add a configuration for node
